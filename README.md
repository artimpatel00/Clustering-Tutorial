# Clustering-Tutorial
This tutorial seeks to provide a detailed overview of these five different
types of clustering:

1. K-means
2. Fuzzy clustering
3. Hierarchical Clustering
4. Density Based Scan Clustering (DBSCAN)
5. Gaussian Mixture Model

We will highlight the differences and practical applications associated
with each of these clustering approaches. To illustrate the behavior and
nature of various clustering algorithms and techniques, we will use two
sample data sets, and coding practice tutorials. The datasets include 
spatially sampled trajectories of hand written digits from the Open
Machine Learning Project, http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml and spatial data 
on earthquakes in California from the United States Geological Survey 
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/.
